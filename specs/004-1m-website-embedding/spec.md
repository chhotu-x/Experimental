# Feature Specification: 1M Website Embedding with Advanced Automation Controls

**Feature Branch**: `004-1m-website-embedding`  
**Created**: September 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "update this project. in this updates achieve the possible to embeds 1M website at the same time, real time and controls 1M from advanced inbuilt {{automation }} controls features. with support tops countrys proxies and user agent and possible to user view live 1m embedded websites with auto control view only after auto controls start by user."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description parsed: Mass-scale website embedding with automation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: system users, embedded websites, automation engine
   ‚Üí Actions: embed websites, control automation, view live feeds, proxy rotation
   ‚Üí Data: website URLs, proxy configurations, automation scripts, user sessions
   ‚Üí Constraints: 1M simultaneous connections, real-time performance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Definition of "advanced automation controls"]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific automation actions to be performed]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data retention requirements for embedded sessions]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: User initiates mass embedding with automation controls
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement addresses scalability, real-time control, and viewing capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Embedded Website Sessions, Automation Rules, Proxy Configurations, User Controls
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding automation details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to simultaneously embed and control up to 1 million websites in real-time so that I can monitor, automate actions across multiple web properties, and view their live states through a unified interface with geographic proxy distribution and user agent rotation for enhanced accessibility and security.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has access to the system, **When** they initiate embedding of 1M websites with automation enabled, **Then** the system successfully establishes connections to all specified websites through distributed proxies
2. **Given** 1M websites are embedded and running, **When** the user activates automation controls, **Then** the system executes predefined automation rules across all embedded websites simultaneously
3. **Given** automation is active on embedded websites, **When** the user requests live viewing, **Then** the system provides real-time visual access to any subset of the 1M embedded websites
4. **Given** the system is operating at full capacity, **When** proxy rotation is triggered, **Then** all connections seamlessly switch to new proxy endpoints from supported countries without interrupting operations
5. **Given** multiple automation rules are configured, **When** the user modifies control parameters, **Then** changes are applied across all relevant embedded websites within seconds

### Edge Cases
- What happens when embedded websites become unavailable or timeout during mass operations?
- How does the system handle proxy failures or country-specific access restrictions?
- What occurs when automation controls conflict or produce unexpected results across different website types?
- How does the system manage resource allocation when approaching the 1M concurrent limit?
- What happens when user agent rotation triggers anti-bot detection on embedded websites?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support simultaneous embedding of up to 1,000,000 websites with stable connections
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide real-time automation control capabilities across all embedded websites
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate proxy support from top countries with automatic rotation and failover
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement user agent rotation to enhance accessibility and reduce detection
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable live viewing of embedded websites after automation controls are activated by the user
- **FR-006**: System MUST process automation control changes across 1M websites within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable response time not specified - seconds, minutes?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain connection stability during proxy rotation without interrupting ongoing operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide user interface for managing and monitoring the status of all embedded websites
- **FR-009**: System MUST log all automation activities and system events for audit and troubleshooting
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle graceful degradation when individual embedded websites fail or become unreachable
- **FR-011**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: types of automation controls not specified - form filling, clicking, scrolling, data extraction?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST authenticate and authorize users before granting access to mass embedding capabilities
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide real-time performance metrics and system health monitoring
- **FR-014**: System MUST support configuration management for automation rules and proxy settings
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement rate limiting and resource management to prevent system overload

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Embedded Website Session**: Represents an active connection to a specific website, including status, proxy assignment, automation state, and performance metrics
- **Automation Rule**: Defines specific actions to be performed on embedded websites, including triggers, conditions, and execution parameters
- **Proxy Configuration**: Contains proxy server details, geographic location, rotation schedule, and health status
- **User Control Interface**: Manages user interactions, permissions, and real-time control commands for the embedding system
- **Live View Session**: Represents active visual monitoring of embedded websites, including view preferences and update frequency
- **System Performance Metrics**: Tracks resource utilization, connection statistics, automation execution results, and system health indicators
