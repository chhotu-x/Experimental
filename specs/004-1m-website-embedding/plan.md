# Implementation Plan: 1M Website Embedding with Advanced Automation Controls

**Branch**: `004-1m-website-embedding` | **Date**: 2025-09-12 | **Spec**: [/specs/004-1m-website-embedding/spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-1m-website-embedding/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path ✓
   → Spec found and analyzed
2. Fill Technical Context ✓
   → Detected Project Type: web (frontend+backend)
   → Set Structure Decision: distributed architecture with massive scalability
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section ✓
   → Violations exist due to scale requirements
   → Justification: 1M concurrent connections requires specialized architecture
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md ✓
   → All clarifications resolved for MVP
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Validation after design complete
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a massively scalable web embedding system capable of handling 1 million simultaneous website connections with real-time automation controls, global proxy support, user agent rotation, and live viewing capabilities. System must provide unified interface for monitoring and controlling embedded websites with advanced automation features.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js 18+, JavaScript ES2022  
**Primary Dependencies**: Express.js 4.18.2, Socket.IO 4.7.2, Puppeteer 21.1.1, Cluster management, Redis 7.2  
**Storage**: Redis (session management), MongoDB (automation rules), JSON files (proxy configs)  
**Testing**: Jest, Supertest, Artillery (load testing), Puppeteer test framework  
**Target Platform**: Linux server cluster, containerizable, Kubernetes ready  
**Project Type**: web - requires frontend+backend+worker structure  
**Performance Goals**: 1M concurrent connections, <1s automation response time, <100ms UI updates  
**Constraints**: Real-time performance, proxy rotation without interruption, memory per connection <1MB  
**Scale/Scope**: 1M concurrent users, distributed worker architecture, global proxy network

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 6 (web-server, automation-engine, proxy-manager, live-viewer, performance-monitor, worker-coordinator) - exceeds limit but justified for massive scale
- Using framework directly? Express.js, Socket.IO used directly, no wrapper classes
- Single data model? Shared schemas for website sessions, automation rules, proxy configs
- Avoiding patterns? Repository pattern required for scale, justified by performance needs

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Libraries: embedding-core, automation-engine, proxy-rotation, live-streaming, performance-monitoring
- Libraries listed: 
  - embedding-core: website connection management
  - automation-engine: rule execution and control
  - proxy-rotation: geographic proxy management
  - live-streaming: real-time viewing capabilities
  - performance-monitoring: system metrics and health
- CLI per library: embed-manager, automation-cli, proxy-cli, viewer-cli, monitor-cli
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned for all libraries

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes, test-driven approach for all components
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Contract tests → Integration → E2E → Unit
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Redis, MongoDB, actual proxy services in integration tests
- Integration tests for: proxy rotation, automation execution, live streaming, load balancing
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes, unified logging across all components
- Frontend logs → backend? Real-time log streaming for monitoring
- Error context sufficient? Detailed error tracking for each embedded website

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0 (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes, automated versioning
- Breaking changes handled? Parallel testing, blue-green deployment strategy

## Phase 2 Task Generation Approach

When /tasks is executed, tasks will be generated following this dependency order:

1. **Setup Tasks**: Project structure, dependencies, linting, CI/CD
2. **Contract Tests [P]**: API endpoints, WebSocket events, automation commands
3. **Core Library Tasks [P]**: Each library can be developed in parallel
4. **Integration Tasks**: Database connections, proxy integrations, message queues
5. **Load Testing Tasks**: Performance validation, scaling tests
6. **Polish Tasks [P]**: Documentation, optimization, monitoring

Key parallel execution groups:
- Libraries can be developed simultaneously once contracts are defined
- Different automation types can be implemented in parallel
- Proxy management and live streaming are independent systems
- Frontend and backend components have clear API boundaries

Each task will include specific file paths, acceptance criteria, and dependency requirements for immediate execution by development agents.
