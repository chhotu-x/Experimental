   → Libraries: embedding-core, automation-engine, proxy-rotation, live-streaming, performance-monitoring
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Not found - generating based on spec requirements
   → contracts/: Not found - generating based on API requirements
   → research.md: Not found - proceeding with plan details
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: distributed architecture, dependencies, cluster configuration
   → Tests: API contracts, WebSocket events, load testing
   → Core: libraries for embedding, automation, proxy management
   → Integration: Redis, MongoDB, proxy services
   → Polish: monitoring, optimization, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Libraries can be developed in parallel [P]
   → API endpoints sequential for shared router
   → Worker processes can be parallel [P]
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph for massive scale requirements
7. Create parallel execution examples for 1M connection handling
8. Validate task completeness:

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run simultaneously
- Critical path: Contract tests → Models → Services → APIs → Workers → Scaling
- Load testing validates each scale milestone (10k → 100k → 500k → 1M)
- Real proxy services integration happens in final phases
- Each library maintains independent test suite
- Worker processes designed for horizontal scaling

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All core libraries have corresponding models and services
- [x] All API endpoints have contract tests
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD enforced)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files/modules)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Load testing covers scaling requirements (1M connections)
- [x] Real-time features (automation, live viewing) properly tested
- [x] Worker architecture supports massive scale requirements
