**Storage**: In-memory with Redis caching (planned), session persistence  
**Testing**: Jest framework (to be implemented)  
**Target Platform**: Linux server, containerized deployment  
**Project Type**: web - Express.js middleware system with frontend  
**Performance Goals**: 1M+ concurrent embeddings, <50ms cached response, 10k+ req/s  
**Constraints**: <16GB memory per node, 99.99% uptime, graceful degradation  
**Scale/Scope**: 1M simultaneous embeddings, 10k+ live viewers, real-time controls

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 3 (middleware engine, frontend dashboard, API layer)
- Using framework directly? YES - Express.js middleware pattern
- Single data model? YES - unified embedding state management
- Avoiding patterns? YES - direct event-driven architecture, no over-abstraction

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? YES - ParallelEmbeddingEngine as reusable middleware
- Libraries listed: 
  - parallel-embedding.js (core engine)
  - proxy-pool.js (connection management)
  - monitoring.js (real-time metrics)
- CLI per library: API endpoints with JSON responses for automation
- Library docs: API documentation in OpenAPI format planned

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? TO BE IMPLEMENTED
- Git commits show tests before implementation? TO BE IMPLEMENTED
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? TO BE IMPLEMENTED
- Real dependencies used? YES - actual proxy connections, real websites
- Integration tests for: embedding engine, proxy pool, worker management
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test (current state needs testing retrofit)

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? PARTIAL - console logging exists
- Frontend logs → backend? PLANNED - real-time dashboard
- Error context sufficient? NEEDS ENHANCEMENT

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0 (initial production release)
- BUILD increments on every change? TO BE IMPLEMENTED
- Breaking changes handled? Migration plan for existing embeddings

## Phase 0: Research Questions

### Performance Architecture
- **Worker Management**: Optimal ratio of worker threads vs cluster processes for 1M scale?
- **Memory Distribution**: How to partition 16GB across embeddings, caching, and overhead?
- **Connection Pooling**: HTTP agent configuration for maximum proxy efficiency?
- **Sharding Strategy**: Optimal shard size and distribution for 1M embeddings?

### Real-time Capabilities
- **WebSocket Scaling**: Connection limits and message throughput for live viewing?
- **State Synchronization**: How to maintain consistency across distributed workers?
- **Command Propagation**: Real-time command distribution to 1M active embeddings?
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Performance impact of real-time metrics collection?

### Production Deployment
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm for auto-scaling?
- **Load Balancing**: Session affinity requirements for stateful embeddings?
- **Persistence Strategy**: Redis cluster configuration for session storage?
- **Health Monitoring**: Graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms?

## Phase 1: Design Documents

### Contracts (API Endpoints)
- `POST /api/embed/massive` - Initiate 1M scale embedding batch
- `GET /api/embed/status/{batchId}` - Real-time batch progress
- `WebSocket /live/{sessionId}` - Live viewing and control
- `POST /api/automation/commands` - Real-time command execution

### Data Models
- **EmbeddingBatch**: Batch metadata and sharding information
- **EmbeddingSession**: Individual website embedding state
- **AutomationCommand**: Real-time command structure
- **PerformanceMetrics**: System monitoring data

### Quickstart Scenarios
- **Basic 1M Embedding**: Initialize and monitor large-scale batch
- **Real-time Control**: Execute commands across active embeddings
- **Live Monitoring**: View system performance and embedding progress
- **Automation Rules**: Configure and deploy automation workflows

## Phase 2: Task Generation Approach

### Testing Infrastructure (RED-GREEN-Refactor)
1. **Performance Tests**: Load testing for 1M concurrent embeddings
2. **Integration Tests**: Worker thread and cluster communication
3. **Contract Tests**: API endpoint validation and error handling
4. **E2E Tests**: Complete embedding workflows with real websites

### Production Readiness
1. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting
2. **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery
4. **Documentation**: API docs and deployment guides

### Optimization Tasks
1. **Memory Management**: Garbage collection and leak prevention
2. **Connection Optimization**: HTTP agent tuning and pooling
3. **Caching Layer**: Redis integration for session persistence
4. **Security Hardening**: Input validation and rate limiting
