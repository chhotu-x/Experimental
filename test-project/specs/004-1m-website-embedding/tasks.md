# Tasks: 1M Website Embedding System Production Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-1m-website-embedding/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅ (required), research.md ❌, data-model.md ❌, contracts/ ❌

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Extract: Node.js 16+, Express 4.18, worker_threads, cluster, WebSocket tech stack
   → Architecture: ParallelEmbeddingEngine with 1M+ capacity (EXISTING)
   → Features: Massive scale embedding, real-time controls, live viewing (IMPLEMENTED)
2. Load optional design documents:
   → No additional design documents found - generating from existing implementation
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Testing infrastructure, performance monitoring, production deployment
   → Tests: Contract tests for APIs, integration tests for 1M scale, performance validation
   → Core: Production optimization, monitoring enhancement, security hardening  
   → Integration: WebSocket scaling, Redis caching, container deployment
   → Polish: Documentation, CI/CD pipeline, comprehensive monitoring
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file modifications = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD - CRITICAL for production readiness)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph for 1M scale production deployment
7. Create parallel execution examples for testing and deployment tasks
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All existing APIs have comprehensive tests?
   → 1M scale performance requirements covered?
   → Production deployment pipeline complete?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for 1M scale production deployment)
```

## Implementation Notes

### Existing ParallelEmbeddingEngine API Coverage (IMPLEMENTED ✅)
- ✅ `embedMassiveScale(websites, options)` - Core 1M embedding capability
- ✅ `embedWebsites(websites, options)` - Batch embedding functionality  
- ✅ `embedSingleWebsite(url, options)` - Single website embedding
- ✅ `getEmbeddingStatus(embeddingId)` - Individual embedding status
- ✅ `getBatchStatus(batchId)` - Batch progress monitoring
- ✅ `getSystemStatus()` - System health and performance metrics
- ✅ `enableAutomationControls(sessionId, rules)` - Automation setup
- ✅ `executeRealTimeCommand(sessionId, command)` - Real-time command execution
- ✅ `enableLiveViewing(options)` - Live viewing configuration
- ✅ `createLiveViewingSession(embeddingIds, options)` - Live session management

### Existing API Endpoints (IMPLEMENTED ✅)
- ✅ `POST /api/embedding/massive-scale` - Massive scale embedding
- ✅ `GET /api/embedding/massive-scale/:batchId/status` - Batch progress
- ✅ `GET /api/embed/status/:embeddingId` - Individual embedding status
- ✅ `GET /api/embed/batch/:batchId` - Batch status  
- ✅ `GET /api/system/status` - System status and health
- ✅ `GET /api/system/health` - Health check endpoint
- ✅ `GET /api/proxy/status` - Proxy pool status

### Production Readiness Gaps (NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION ⚠️)
- ❌ **No comprehensive test suite** - Critical for production deployment
- ❌ **No performance validation** - Must test 1M scale requirements  
- ❌ **No production deployment** - Docker, K8s, CI/CD pipeline missing
- ❌ **No monitoring/alerting** - Prometheus metrics, dashboards needed
- ❌ **No error handling** - Production-grade error handling and recovery
- ❌ **No security audit** - Input validation, rate limiting, authentication
- ❌ **No documentation** - API docs, operations manual, deployment guide

### Testing Strategy (TDD - CRITICAL)
1. **RED Phase**: Write failing tests for all existing APIs and 1M scale requirements
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implement production optimizations to pass tests  
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Optimize for production performance and reliability
4. **Real Dependencies**: Use actual Redis, proxy connections, worker threads for integration tests
5. **Performance Gates**: All tests must meet 1M scale performance targets before production
