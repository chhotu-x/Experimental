# Feature Specification: Constitution Compliance Refactor

**Branch**: `002-constitution-compliance-refactor` | **Date**: 2025-09-12 | **Priority**: High
**Input**: Analysis of Experimental-main project violations of constitution principles

## Problem Statement *(mandatory)*

The current Experimental-main tech website project violates multiple constitution principles:

1. **Library-First Violation**: Monolithic server.js file (962 lines) with embedded business logic
2. **CLI Interface Missing**: No command-line interface for any functionality
3. **Test-First Violation**: No tests whatsoever (`"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"`)
4. **Observability Gaps**: Basic console logging only, no structured logging or monitoring
5. **Versioning Issues**: No versioning strategy, no build increment tracking
6. **Complexity Accumulation**: Single file handling web server, middleware, routing, and business logic

The project cannot evolve safely or be maintained effectively in its current state.

## User Value *(mandatory)*

**Primary Value**: Transform the tech website into a maintainable, testable, and modular system that can be developed and deployed with confidence.

**Target Users**:
- **Developers**: Need isolated libraries for development, testing, and debugging
- **DevOps Engineers**: Need CLI tools for deployment, monitoring, and maintenance
- **QA Teams**: Need automated testing and clear contract validation
- **Site Administrators**: Need monitoring, logging, and operational visibility

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to work on website features in isolation so that I can test, develop, and deploy components independently without affecting the entire system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a feature change is needed, **When** I modify a library, **Then** I can test it in isolation with CLI commands
2. **Given** the website is running, **When** an error occurs, **Then** I can trace it through structured logs and monitoring
3. **Given** I need to deploy, **When** I run CLI deployment commands, **Then** I get version-controlled, tested deployments
4. **Given** I'm developing new features, **When** I write tests first, **Then** the system enforces TDD workflow

### Edge Cases
- What happens when library dependencies conflict?
- How does the system handle partial deployments?
- What monitoring exists for performance degradation?
- How are breaking changes managed across libraries?

## Functional Requirements *(mandatory)*

### FR1: Library-First Architecture
- Extract middleware, routing, data handling, and UI rendering into separate libraries
- Each library must be independently testable and documented
- Libraries must expose CLI interfaces for all primary functions

### FR2: Comprehensive Testing Framework
- Contract tests for all API endpoints and library interfaces
- Integration tests for request/response flows and data persistence
- Unit tests for business logic and utility functions
- Performance tests for response times and throughput

### FR3: CLI Interface Layer
- Website management CLI for start/stop/reload operations
- Content management CLI for posts, pages, and configuration
- Monitoring CLI for health checks, logs, and metrics
- Deployment CLI for versioning, migrations, and rollbacks

### FR4: Structured Observability
- Request/response logging with correlation IDs
- Performance metrics collection and reporting
- Error tracking with stack traces and context
- Health check endpoints for monitoring systems

### FR5: Version Management
- MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD versioning for all libraries
- Automated version increment on every change
- Breaking change detection and migration planning
- Dependency version tracking and compatibility checking

## Technical Constraints *(mandatory)*

### Performance Requirements
- Website response time: <200ms p95
- CLI commands: <2s execution time
- Test suite: <30s full run
- Memory usage: <512MB per library

### Compatibility Requirements
- Node.js 18+ support maintained
- Express.js framework preserved for web layer
- EJS templating maintained for views
- Existing routes and functionality preserved

### Deployment Constraints
- Zero-downtime deployments required
- Backward compatibility for 2 minor versions
- Database migrations must be reversible
- Configuration changes require CLI validation

## Entities & Relationships *(auto-generated)*

### Core Entities
- **WebServer**: HTTP server management and routing
- **ContentManager**: Blog posts, pages, and static content handling
- **MiddlewareStack**: Security, performance, and request processing
- **ConfigurationManager**: Environment settings and feature flags
- **MonitoringCollector**: Metrics, logs, and health data aggregation

### Relationships
- WebServer depends on MiddlewareStack and ContentManager
- ContentManager reads from data files and cache
- MiddlewareStack applies security and performance optimizations
- MonitoringCollector aggregates data from all components
- ConfigurationManager provides settings to all libraries

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Immediate (Phase 1)
- [ ] All tests pass with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Every library has working CLI interface
- [ ] Website functionality identical to current version
- [ ] Structured logging implemented across all components

### Short-term (Phase 2)
- [ ] Sub-200ms response times maintained
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment capability
- [ ] Full observability dashboard operational
- [ ] TDD workflow enforced in development

### Long-term (Phase 3)
- [ ] Independent library versioning and releases
- [ ] Automated performance regression detection
- [ ] Production monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Developer onboarding time reduced to <1 hour

## Out of Scope *(mandatory)*

- Frontend JavaScript framework changes (maintain vanilla JS)
- Database migration (continue using JSON file storage)
- Cloud platform migration (maintain current hosting approach)
- UI/UX redesign (preserve existing design and functionality)
- Additional features beyond current website capabilities
