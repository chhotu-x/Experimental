# Tasks: Code Efficiency and Feature Enhancements

**Input**: Existing implementation analysis from `/Experimental-main/`
**Tech Stack**: Node.js + Express, Cheerio, Axios, WebSocket, Helmet, EJS
**Focus**: Performance optimization, testing infrastructure, monitoring, and production readiness

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Analyze existing implementation from Experimental-main/
   → Tech Stack: Node.js 16+, Express 4.18, Cheerio 1.1, WebSocket support
   → Architecture: Middleware-based with parallel processing (parallel-embedding.js)
   → Features: 1M website embedding, real-time controls, proxy management
   → Missing: Test suite, performance monitoring, caching, production deployment
2. Generate enhancement tasks based on:
   → Testing: Jest framework, unit/integration/performance tests
   → Performance: Redis caching, memory optimization, load balancing
   → Monitoring: Real-time dashboards, metrics collection, alerting
   → Production: Docker, CI/CD, security hardening, documentation
3. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = [P] parallel execution
   → Same file modifications = sequential
   → Tests before implementation (TDD approach)
4. Order by dependencies: Setup → Tests → Core → Integration → Polish
5. Return: Ready-to-execute tasks for immediate implementation
```
